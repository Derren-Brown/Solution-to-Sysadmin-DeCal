## Q1

**Paste the contents of `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` from your student VM.**

### Answer

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AABAIBbpOeshZjo5sgYc6ItLkYN43qT8HJwHl8h21oSO441O skyzheng@Sky's MacBook Pro
```

## Q2

**What are the permissions on your public key and private key? Why do you think they are the way they are?**

### Answer

The owner(me) has the permission to read and write both public and private key, which is acceptable since the owner created the keys and should have the access to them. 

However, other group members have only read permission of the public key and no permission for the private key. This is also natural since the public key is open to everyone and the private key should be kept secretly to the owner.

## EC1

**configure `sshd` to only allow key-based login**

### Steps

1. Edit '/etc/ssh/sshd_config', like `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

2. Uncomment `PasswordAuthentication` and set its value to `no`

3. Save and Quit

4. Reload the `sshd` service using `sudo systemctl reload sshd` (system using `systemctl`)

## Q3

**What command did you use to enable a port?**

### Answer

`sudo ufw allow <port>`

## Q4

**Paste the output of `sudo ufw status verbose`. Make sure you can clearly see the changes you made in the steps above!**

### Answer

```
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22                         ALLOW IN    10.147.18.0/24
9993                       ALLOW IN    10.147.18.0/24
```

## Q5

**Why is setting up a firewall important? What are some security concerns that might arise from exposing a port?**

### Answer

Setting up a firewall is important because it acts as a barrier that controls the traffic between your internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. It helps to prevent unauthorized access and cyber attacks.

Exposing a port can be risky because it may:

1. Allow attackers to access or attack the system if the service on the port is vulnerable.
2. Be targeted for exploitation, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
3. Be overwhelmed by traffic in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
4. Allow sensitive data to be intercepted if not encrypted.

## EC2

**Allow the above, but only for IPs originating from UC Berkeleyâ€™s subnet. UC Berkeley has 3 primary `/16`s.**

### Steps

1. `sudo ufw allow from x.x.x.x/16 to any port 22`

## EC3

**Configure `fail2ban` to block IP addresses that are trying to brute-force your SSH password.**

### Steps

1. `sudo apt update && sudo apt install fail2ban` to install fail2ban

2. `sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local` to edit the config file

3. Edit the `sshd` config

```File: /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
findtime = 600
bantime = 3600
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1
```

4. `sudo systemctl restart fail2ban` to reload the new config
5. Using `sudo fail2ban-client status sshd` to check status
```
Status for the jail: sshd
|- Filter
|  |- Currently failed: 0
|  |- Total failed:     0
|  `- File list:        /var/log/auth.log
`- Actions
   |- Currently banned: 0
   |- Total banned:     0
   `- Banned IP list:
```
